        <h1>About Us:</h1>
        <p>
          We are an animal shelter dedicated to helping out pets of many sizes and shapes!
          We began in 2022 due to a passion in our founders to promote the adoption of 
          animals that need a home. We hope you browse through our pet category and find an adorable
          friend to take home with you!
        </p>

          If you would like to contact us about adoption, donations, volunteering, or any other questions
          you may have, please refer to our details down below.
